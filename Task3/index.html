            <h2>Technology</h2>
            Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve
            practical goals, especially in a reproducible way.[1] The word
            technology can also mean the products resulting from such
            efforts,[2][3] including both tangible tools such as utensils or
            machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a
            critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
            Technological advancements have led to significant changes in
            society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used
            during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which
            contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of
            language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the
            Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex
            machines. More recent technological inventions, including the
            printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers
            to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.

            <h2>History</h2>
            Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and
            trial and error.[11] Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned
            to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble,
            forming a sharp hand axe.[12] This practice was refined 75 kya
            (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer
            work.[13] The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as
            "possibly the greatest ever made by man".[14] Archaeological,
            dietary, and social evidence point to "continuous [human] fire-use"
            at least 1.5 Mya.[15] Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed
            early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility,
            improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that
            could be eaten.[16] The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability
            to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size, though some
            researchers find the evidence inconclusive.[17] Archaeological
            evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya; researchers believe this
            is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have
            contributed to the emergence of language

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic
            growth.[62][63] Throughout human history, energy production was the
            main constraint on economic development, and new technologies
            allowed humans to significantly increase the amount of available
            energy. First came fire, which made edible a wider variety of foods,
            and made it less physically demanding to digest them. Fire also
            enabled smelting, and the use of tin, copper, and iron tools, used
            for hunting or tradesmanship. Then came the agricultural revolution:
            humans no longer needed to hunt or gather to survive, and began to
            settle in towns and cities, forming more complex societies, with
            militaries and more organized forms of religion.[64] Technologies
            have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity,
            improved comfort and quality of life, and medical progress, but they
            can also disrupt existing social hierarchies, cause pollution, and
            harm individuals or groups. Recent years have brought about a rise
            in social media's cultural prominence, with potential repercussions
            on democracy, and economic and social life. Early on, the internet
            was seen as a "liberation technology" that would democratize
            knowledge, improve access to education, and promote democracy.
            Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides,
            including disinformation, polarization, hate speech, and propaganda.

            <h2>Ethics</h2>
            The ethics of technology is an interdisciplinary subfield of ethics
            that analyzes technology's ethical implications and explores ways to
            mitigate the potential negative impacts of new technologies. There
            is a broad range of ethical issues revolving around technology, from
            specific areas of focus affecting professionals working with
            technology to broader social, ethical, and legal issues concerning
            the role of technology in society and everyday life.[92] Prominent
            debates have surrounded genetically modified organisms, the use of
            robotic soldiers, algorithmic bias, and the issue of aligning AI
            behavior with human values.[93] Technology ethics encompasses
            several key fields. Bioethics looks at ethical issues surrounding
            biotechnologies and modern medicine, including cloning, human
            genetic engineering, and stem cell research. Computer ethics focuses
            on issues related to computing. Cyberethics explores
            internet-related issues like intellectual property rights, privacy,
            and censorship. Nanoethics examines issues surrounding the
            alteration of matter at the atomic and molecular level in various
            disciplines including computer science, engineering, and biology.
            And engineering ethics deals with the professional standards of
            engineers, including software engineers and their moral
            responsibilities to the public

            <h2>Emerging Technologies</h2>
            Emerging technologies are novel technologies whose development or
            practical applications are still largely unrealized. They include
            nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, 3D printing, blockchains,
            and artificial intelligence. In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil claimed
            the next technological revolution would rest upon advances in
            genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, with robotics being the most
            impactful of the three technologies.[103] Genetic engineering will
            allow far greater control over human biological nature through a
            process called directed evolution. Some thinkers believe that this
            may shatter our sense of self, and have urged for renewed public
            debate exploring the issue more thoroughly;[104] others fear that
            directed evolution could lead to eugenics or extreme social
            inequality. Nanotechnology will grant us the ability to manipulate
            matter "at the molecular and atomic scale",[105] which could allow
            us to reshape ourselves and our environment in fundamental
            ways.[106] Nanobots could be used within the human body to destroy
            cancer cells or form new body parts, blurring the line between
            biology and technology.[107] Autonomous robots have undergone rapid
            progress, and are expected to replace humans at many dangerous
            tasks, including search and rescue, bomb disposal, firefighting, and
            war.
